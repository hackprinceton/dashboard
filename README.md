HackPrinceton Dashboard
============

HackPrinceton's real-time event dashboard for use during the hackathon. This was created to make hackathon information easily accessible during the event and to make the administrator's life easier.

Workflow
--------
```master``` branch is for all commits in the process of being staged for deployment. ```gh-pages``` is our production site. Merge ```master``` with ```gh-pages``` to deploy.

Deploy
------
Just dump all of the files in this repo into a web server and start it up. No server-side scripting needed. Easy as pie.
